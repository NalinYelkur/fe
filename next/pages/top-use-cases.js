</h2>

                <p>
                Most millennials only preferred texting as a mode of communication.

                </p>

                <p>
                We've come to prefer texting to call in many situations. And for a good reason: texting reduces stress, allows you to think about what you're going to say before responding, lets you multitask, and is more secure because it can't be "overheard."

                </p>
                <p>
                Because of its widespread popularity, texting has moved beyond dedicated messaging apps and into the functionality of other apps in the form of in-app conversations. Live chats are available in almost every customer-facing app. A live chat function is almost always beneficial when a business involves communication.
