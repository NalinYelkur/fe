                  <p>
                    Developing an instant messaging application is simpler with
                    PlugtoChat Chat APIs & SDKs for iOS and Android.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Today Messaging applications have certainly changed the way
                    we communicate. In recent years, the popularity of these
                    messaging apps has grabbed the interest of so many business
                    people and enthusiastic developers to think about how to
                    build a chat platform of their own.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Chat refers to instantaneous text communication between two
                    or more end-users of an app. Direct Messages are the most
                    common implementation of In-app Chat by a wide margin. It
                    always keeps the users connected on any channel.

                Chat API is a programming interface that enables you to
                connect to cloud-based infrastructures with various
                features to build unique real-time chat experiences.
                They're usually offered as services, and the chat Software
                Development Kit can be used to incorporate them into an
                app (SDK).

                    <h4>What platforms and Technologies do they support?</h4>
                    <p>
                      Whether you add communication features on websites,
                      smartphones, or tablets will inform your choice of API
                      vendor. Even if APIs tend to be web-based, the chat SDKs
                      often used alongside the API are platform-specific (e.g.,
                      iOS, Android, web) so pick one platform compatible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To ensure compatibility, you also need to consider your
                      broader technology stack (e.g., HTTP, Push/Streaming,
                      Ajax, WebSocket, REST, XMPP). For example, if you are
                      hoping to add audio chat to your app and make the most of
                      WebRTC technology, make sure you choose an API/SDK that
                      works for this setup.

                    <h4 className="mb-0">Real-Time Messaging API</h4>

                    <p>
                      A messaging API typically refers to any service that
                      provides developers with the building blocks to program
                      messaging capabilities in an application. Unlike chat
                      APIs, messaging APIs often include MMS, SMS, and instant
                      messaging. Messaging APIs are important because they allow
                      you to quickly and securely send messages without focusing
                      on backend systems since the infrastructure is ready to
                      use.
                    </p>

                    <h4 className="mb-0">
                      What can you do with a Messaging API?
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                      Reliable messaging APIs allow you to send and receive
                      messages Globally, reaching users anywhere in the world.
                      This is done by having data pushed to users or devices in
                      real-time. For example, PubNub uses a Pub/Sub Messaging
                      approach that gives you the ability to stream data as it
                      occurs from any number of users or devices continuously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With this approach, you have multiple options for how to
                      send and receive data through your platform. You can
                      trigger messages and user actions through JavaScript
                      business logic, deliver low latency messaging, or
                      implement custom functions with our serverless environment
                      to provide a personalized experience for your users.

                    <h4 className="mb-0">
                      How Messaging APIs can add value to your use case
                    </h4>

                    <p>
                      Messaging APIs can add value to your use case by giving
                      you the ability to enhance the user experience. Whether
                      itâ€™s simply sending a bulk SMS message to an iOS phone
                      number or sharing humorous GIFs among user communities,
                      messaging APIs provide your users with interactive
                      features and give you full control to customize your
                      in-app experience the way you want.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      From live concerts to dating apps, real-time messaging
                      features can be implemented in a private or group chat to
                      show user activity on your platform. For instance, you may
                      have noticed on some messaging apps that it is displayed
                      when a user is actively working on a message or that a
                      read receipt appears in a chat when you message.
