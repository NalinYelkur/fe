                  <p>
                    Learning sessions are interactive if we bridge the gap
                    between students and teachers. To ensure concepts are
                    communicated clearly, direct chat integration is necessary
                    to your existing web & mobile app. With dedicated chat
                    rooms, students and teachers can solve problems together in
                    real-time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Once you allow the PlugtoChat SDK to integrate chat features
                    into your existing web & mobile app, it will deliver
                    one-to-one or multi-student chat to enhance the learning.
