                  <p>
                    According to Gartner reports that during the past four
                    years, there has been a 270% increase in the number of
                    enterprises implementing artificial intelligence. However,
                    there are many misunderstandings about everything
                    AI-related. In contrast to popular belief, the area of AI
                    has been studied for almost 70 years. As a result, this
                    decade (and mainly 2022) will be crucial for AI and its
                    related sectors because three fundamental causes are
                    anticipated to cause a significant shift towards AI and
                    intelligent automation: to decrease staff costs and reliance
                    on human capital, to boost productivity the accessibility
                    and affordability of AI-based methods.

                    <p>
                      eCommerce companies have access to staggering amounts of
                      data that include crucial parameters that may be utilized
                      to develop more effective sales, marketing, and production
                      plans and make better data-driven decisions in general.
                      Additionally, eCommerce companies are employing AI and big
                      data analytics to routinely scan their website to identify
                      fraudulent reviews and search the internet for trigger
                      words in social media posts, blogs, and even tweets.
                    </p>
                    <h4 className='mb-0'>Retargeting and Lead Engagement:</h4>

                    <p>
                      eCommerce companies get a lot of information about leads
                      or potential clients. AI can contact warm and cold leads,
                      some of whom may not be familiar with the brand.
                      Additionally, it has been demonstrated that AI is a highly
                      effective tool for remarketing clients. Retargeting is a
                      type of marketing that aims to attract clients who are in
                      the buying process but have not made a purchase.
                      Conversational AI is one of the most personalized business
                      messaging types.

                    <h4 className='mb-0'>Conversational AI Chatbots:</h4>

                    <p>
                      A new breed of virtual agents uses recent advancements in
                      natural language processing (NLP) and natural language
                      comprehension (NLU). These chatbots can have realistic
                      conversations by analyzing the conversation's context,
                      figuring out the customer's goal, and even creating new
                      responses utilizing a vast knowledge library.
                    </p>
                    <h4 className='mb-0'>Contextual Search:</h4>
                    <p>
                      Websites and Mobile Apps can use contextual search, a
                      potent AI tool, to deliver more precise search results. To
                      improve the accuracy of search results, contextual search
                      utilizes an AI engine that examines external data such as
                      seasons, popular subjects, and more. An extension of the
                      contextual search engine uses outside data, such as
                      browser history and cookie data that may have earlier
                      searches, purchase history, etc., to provide tailored
                      recommendations of goods most likely to interest the
                      particular customer.
                    </p>
                    <h4 className='mb-0'>Visual and Voice Search:</h4>
                    <p>
                      Implementing these technologies into your website or
                      mobile app will probably be beneficial as home automation
                      and hands-free searches continue to gain popularity (Alexa
                      and Google Home are two examples of intelligent
                      assistants).
                    </p>
                    <h4 className='mb-0'>Wrapping Up:</h4>
                    <p>
                      Many online and offline businesses have historically
                      resisted the adoption of AI, but shifting consumer habits
                      and market conditions are strong predictors of AI's
                      long-term viability as a critical eCommerce technology in
                      this decade. The cost to develop these solutions has never
                      been lower, and the advantages of AI are now too
                      significant to ignore.
